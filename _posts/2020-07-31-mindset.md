This review is not yet complete, I'm just testing out the code for my website.

That being said, Mindset is one of my favorite books. It's a great characterization of how we think about progress differently for intelligence as opposed to any other activity. It talks about common misconceptions regarding this concept, and how to correct them. 

Easily the most important lesson of the book is that the necessity of hard work should not be viewed as a source of failure, instead that 'the struggle' is something to be embraced, as inevitable, and even enjoyable. It sounds obvious when you say it out loud, but you'd be surprised at how backwards our thinking about this issue is on a societal level, especially when it comes to education.

Definitely add it to your list if you want a refreshing new perspective on one of life's most fundamental inquiries.
