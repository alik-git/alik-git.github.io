Hi there! ðŸ˜ƒ 

My name is Ali, and I specialize in designing and optimizing computer systems to improve data workflows and ensure seamless integration in robotics and AI environments. I have contributed to research projects such as [ConceptFusion][cf_paper] and [ConceptGraphs][cg_paper], focusing on efficient data handling and system architecture for advanced AI and robotics applications.

**I am currently seeking full-time roles and internships in system analysis and optimization, and Iâ€™m open to relocation and non-robotics roles.** You can view my resume [here][cv]. If youâ€™d like to get in touch, please donâ€™t hesitate to email me at ali.hqk@x, x=gmail.com, or connect on Twitter/LinkedIn!

Previously, I interned at the [Alexa AI][aai] team at [Amazon][amzn], where I worked on optimizing system architectures for large language model applications. I also held roles at [Epson][epsn] and [Liquid Analytics][la], focusing on scalable data systems and integration workflows.

My background in computer science and math from the [University of Toronto][uoft] included roles as a Teaching Assistant and co-founder of the [UTM Robotics Club][utmr], as well as recognition through the [NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award][na].

In my free time, youâ€™ll find me listening to audiobooks and podcasts, lifting weights, or juggling. âœŒ
